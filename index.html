            <h3>1. Tandoori Delights: Smoke and Flavor in Every Bite</h3>
            <p>
                Tandoori cooking is one of the most famous aspects of Indian cuisine. It involves cooking marinated meats, vegetables, and seafood in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor. This method imparts a smoky flavor to the food while keeping it tender and juicy. At Top of India, we’ve perfected the art of tandoori cooking, offering a range of delicious options for you to enjoy.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Butter Chicken:</b> A classic favorite, our Butter Chicken is a rich, creamy dish with tender chicken cooked in a velvety tomato-based sauce, perfect for pairing with naan or rice.</li>
                <li><b>Lamb Rogan Josh:</b> This North Indian specialty features tender lamb slow-cooked in a blend of spices, creating a fragrant and deeply flavorful curry.</li>
                <li><b>Paneer Makhani:</b> For vegetarians, our Paneer Makhani is a delicious dish made with cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cooked in a creamy tomato sauce. It’s a perfect option for anyone craving a rich, comforting curry.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Vegetarian Delights: A Celebration of India’s Plant-Based Cuisine</h3>
            <p>
                India is known for its incredible vegetarian food, and at Top of India, we have a variety of dishes that highlight the best of plant-based Indian cuisine. Our vegetarian options are rich in flavor and made with fresh, seasonal ingredients.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <h3>4. Biryani and Rice: Aromatic and Fragrant</h3>
            <p>
                No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornmeal"><u>Indian meal</u></a> is complete without a serving of rice or biryani. Our biryanis are fragrant, flavorful, and loaded with spices and ingredients like saffron, cardamom, and cloves, making them the perfect accompaniment to our curries and tandoori dishes.
            </p>
            <ul>
